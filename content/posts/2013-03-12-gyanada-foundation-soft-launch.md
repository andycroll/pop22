I've thrown myself headlong into work â€” real work, and then foundation work.

India is an important part of my life and I owe everything to her. Over the past couple of months, my friends and I have been busy putting a little NGO together, the [Gyanada Foundation](http://gyanada.org).

Today (Tues, 12 March) between 7 and 9 in the evening, I'll be hosting our soft launch at Artistry, 17 Jalan Pinang.

Here are the [event details](https://www.facebook.com/events/358507430931310/)! Hope to see you there.
