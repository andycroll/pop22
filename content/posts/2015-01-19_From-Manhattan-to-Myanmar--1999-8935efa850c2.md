Nearly every story about Myanmar opens or ends with a photo of Shwedagon, mostly for gratuitous reasons, but this one isn't one of them.

This is a story about a young Burmese man who hadn't been home for years, a news-stand in Manhattan, and a photo of Myanmar's most famous gilded stupa glinting from the cover of a magazine in 1999.

He studied computer science by day at City College, New York, and made a variety of websites on the side. More than a decade outside of Myanmar now, his story would take him the long way home, just as he first arrived in New York via a circuitous route spanning Singapore, Germany, the United Kingdom and finally, America. Most stories about journeys to fame and fortune end with arriving in America, but this isn't one of them, either.

Unlike most other days, where the magazine covers and newspaper front pages would be about news closer to home, home being New York for now, today's was different. In a corner of his eye, Thaung Su Nyein caught a glimpse of the familiar. Shwedagon, in all its glistening glory, staring out at him from the cover of a magazine.

He had not been reminded of Myanmar in such a public way for some time. He remembers feeling _jolted_ by it. News and information about the land of his birth was scarce to come by, which was also why he kept a hobby website which obsessively tracked all news about it. Shwedagon on the front cover of an international magazine was big news, though he felt few others shared his excitement. Purchasing the magazine, he was amazed by the stories he read about the country that he left 11 years ago. A Canadian? In Myanmar? Developing an Internet Service Provider (ISP), albeit rather illegally? The editors breathlessly enthused, Yangon could be the next Ho Chi Minh City. Young people, a burgeoning middle class, and this thing called the _internet_.

He felt he had to be a part of it. Less than a year later, he was back in Myanmar, swimming against the tide (and the generals) in the so-called _internet wave._

Now the CEO of [Information Matrix](http://informationmatrix.com), Thaung Su Nyein is the opposite of what a media mogul is supposed to be like. That's not a moniker he likes, though it's the one most often used to describe him. He is affable and friendly, and sits with me to drink tea and talk about his story. His office in Kamaryut Township, Yangon, is bustling, cavernous, and extremely busy. Everyone always seems to have something to do, somewhere to scurry to.

"The guys I read about in the article? They were all in jail by the time I got back," he says in a deadpan voice. "My first plan when I got back here was to open a cyber-cafe. A sure bet, right? Everyone wants to get online, nobody had computers…"

Trailing off, he seemed to have recalled something amusing. "I had an Internet cafe as a 23 year old, I just got back and I simply started one. The guy with the ISP I read about in the magazine, he had been deported. The very word, _internet_, was a bad word. How can you have a cyber cafe when you can't use the _internet_?"

Ever the problem-solver, he soon found a way around it by serving web pages in a static manner - static webpages, loaded from discs. It wasn't much of a cafe nor one with internet, but it was a small step for Yangon in 1999. That was where Thaung Su Nyein first got his footing in business back in Myanmar; the exposure to the climate then in business, politics and the economy was a huge lesson which would serve him well in time to come.

"I couldn't have a proper Internet cafe, so I started a journal to publish news about the Internet."

With the Internet cafe faltering, he soon turned his attention onto a few other areas. He had many diverse interests, yet news, software and the media always seemed to converge for him. Software development was one of those areas. There was little technical talent then, so he simply had to start his own. Software is now a key component in Information Matrix's stable of knowledge-related businesses, where they now take a special interest in e-government projects on top of being one of the leading software outfits. From a Burmese student running a website about Myanmar out of New York City, he also now owns the [7Day News Journal](http://www.7daynewsjournal.com), one of the leading private weeklies in Myanmar.

"How did I do it? With very little money, electricity and other resources," Thaung Su Nyein says with a laugh.

"You have to remember this was 1999. We had to go to the post office to get email access. I stood in line to get one, so that I could join the active communities like the Linux Special Interest Groups. You had to tell the teller at the counter what ID and password you wanted. The teller would… shout out your password to confirm. It was a time of very little, but of great opportunity."

With capital of $5000, he bought some computers and a handful of optimism. Like many inexperienced entrepreurs, he soon ran into financial trouble.

"I didn't know how to make sense of financial statements. I struggled with payroll. I had no background in trade. I really should have failed."

He quickly ran into debt and had to take on some software development projects. His first project was to build software for a trading company. Then, as many entrepreneurs who have been to the brink and back would tell it, his first big break came when he got his first fairly large project to build an inventory system for a restaurant when they really needed it.

The media was his enduring love. He soon began to add more titles, after receiving a bank loan which helped him to grow the business.

The Internet Journal, which was his first title in 2000, was soon joined by a celebrity magazine in 2001. In 2001, the [7 Day News Journal](http://www.7daynewsjournal.com) became the flagship publication in the stable of titles published by Information Matrix. His vision for clean, crisp reporting was carried out by fresh recruits who he would personally train. The journal became one of the best-selling papers in Myanmar.

In the decade since his return to Myanmar, Thaung Su Nyein had always stayed on the right side of the law.

Yet November 2010 was not an ordinary time. Not for Myanmar, not for Thaung Su Nyein and not for the [7 Day News Journal](http://www.7daynewsjournal.com). Breaking news on the release of Aung San Suu Kyi precipitated a rash of newspaper suspensions across the country: [nine in all](http://www.mmtimes.com/index.php/national-news/4507-nine-journals-suspended-by-censorship-board.html), including the the [7 Day News Journal](http://www.7daynewsjournal.com). Along with the other eight publications, the journal had flouted censorship board regulations and printed photos of the Lady on the front page.

Like all banished media anywhere in the world, circulation leapt the week they returned to business.

"We've been suspended twice in our history," Thaung Su Nyein recalled as though it was supposed to be a fact of life that photograph placement alone is enough to earn a suspension. "The other time was about a murder case. We also got one week for it."

So what's next for someone who seems to have it all?

Like many entrepreneurs of a certain stature, Thaung Su Nyein now wears several hats. He is usually deadpan, but speaks passionately and excitedly about e-government. He is the head of the Myanmar Computer Federation's e-government committee, the software development side of his company focuses on e-government projects, and he posts enthusiastically about e-government projects for Myanmar. His natural bent for software and his access to media power has put him in a unique position, one he is clearly aware of.

"Many obstacles in creating and consuming media and information online in Myanmar are now gone," he remarked. "It's now the right time to focus on building our strengths online, especially with the next elections coming up!"

Mobile news, mobile government services, mobile money, wifi-enabled city projects, from news to infrastructure he is thinking deeply about Myanmar's role in each area.

He is enthusiastic about helping young entrepreneurs learn more about business, having built up his wealth of experience the long way around. "Things are a little easier now. A little. But you still need to know the market. Localization, local preferences, sensitivities, all of those things are the same as before. There's space for everyone."

In many ways, [Myanmar's Second Wind](https://medium.com/myanmars-second-wind) started not two, but 16 years ago for Thaung Su Nyein. Coming and going and coming back again - Yangon again by way of Singapore, Germany, the UK, New York City, it was only fitting that a man of the news would be carried home on the strengths of a single magazine cover.
